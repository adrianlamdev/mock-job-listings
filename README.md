- Job Matching Algorithm (also automatically parse resume to see if student is eligible in terms of requirements): Students should be able to search for jobs based on factors like whether the position is remote or on-site, the flexibility of hours (important for students who have classes to attend), and whether the position is an internship, co-op, or part-time job.

**Getting internship/job information**

- Direct Partnerships with Companies: Reach out to companies directly and propose a partnership where they list their job and internship openings on your platform. This can be particularly effective if you have a unique value proposition, such as a user base of highly qualified students.
- Job Aggregation: Use APIs from existing job boards or platforms to aggregate job listings. Many job boards offer APIs that allow you to pull job listings and display them on your platform. Examples include Indeed, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn.
- User-Generated Content: Allow users (employers) to post job listings directly on your platform. This can be a good way to get a large number of listings, but you'll need to have a system in place to review and approve listings to ensure they meet your platform's standards.
- Partnerships with Universities and Colleges: Many educational institutions have job boards where employers post opportunities specifically for their students. You could form partnerships with these institutions to share these listings on your platform.
- Scraping: Web scraping is a method used to extract large amounts of data from websites. You can scrape job listings from various websites. However, this method should be used with caution as it can have legal and ethical implications.
